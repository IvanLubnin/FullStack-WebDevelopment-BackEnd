VSCode

VSCode offers key features that enhance backend development. It includes an integrated debugger, 
allowing step-by-step code inspection, which is critical for identifying and fixing bugs. VSCode 
also supports a wide range of extensions—such as REST Client, Prettier, and ESLint—that streamline 
backend workflows. Additionally, the built-in terminal lets developers run commands and scripts directly 
within the editor, making it convenient to manage Node.js servers and other backend tools without 
switching applications.

Node.js and Express 

Node.js is a runtime environment for running JavaScript outside the browser, enabling the creation 
of server-side applications. Unlike traditional web servers, Node.js uses an asynchronous, non-blocking 
model, which makes it efficient for handling multiple requests. Express, a web framework for Node.js, 
\simplifies server development by providing an intuitive way to manage routes, use middleware, 
and handle HTTP requests. This is much easier than using Node's built-in HTTP module, which lacks 
these features.

Extensions:

- REST Client: The REST Client extension in VSCode allows developers to test API endpoints directly from 
the editor. This is helpful for testing routes without needing external tools.

- Prettier: Prettier enforces consistent code formatting, making code more readable. It can be configured 
in VSCode settings or via a .prettierrc file, helping teams maintain a uniform style.

-ESLint: ESLint catches common coding mistakes, such as undefined variables or incorrect syntax. It also 
enforces code style rules, which reduces errors and improves readability.

Using Postman:

Postman is widely used for API testing, allowing developers to make requests, inspect responses, 
and manage multiple API environments. Compared to the REST Client in VSCode, Postman offers a more 
visual and user-friendly interface with added features, such as automated testing and API documentation 
tools. However, REST Client is lighter and integrates directly into VSCode, which some developers find 
convenient for simpler tasks.
